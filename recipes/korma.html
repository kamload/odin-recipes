                        <p>This slow-cooked korma recipe is packed with chicken, chickpeas, butternut squash and warming flavours. Cooked in the oven for an hour, the chicken thighs become tender and the rich, spiced sauce becomes beautifully fragrant. Serve with a scattering of flaked almonds and sultanas for a healthy, family favourite dinner.</p>
